# Take 5

> It’s better to use “23” than “twenty-three” to catch users’ eyes when they scan Web pages for facts, according to eyetracking data. — Jakob Nielsen

## Rationale

1. Scan and stop
  - Decimal numerals (e.g., 5, 10, 2019) are easier and faster to scan than numbers written as words (five, ten, two thousand nineteen)
  - Numerals often stop the wandering eye and attract fixations, even within a mass of words that are otherwise ignored; the number is different enough, by design of the letterform itself, to cause pause or a momentary stop
2. Less is more
  - Numbers take up less space than words. This is important when writing for social media and character count in subject lines
3. Context is king
  -  Numbers communicate a technical writing style
    - Take 5 minutes
